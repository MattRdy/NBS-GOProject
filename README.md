# NBS-GOProject
GO Coding Project Repository for NBS

Contained is a completed networking-related GO Coding Project, provided to me by Krish Nair of NBS Payment Solutions. 

It's my first attempt at GO coding, and while it certainly provided a measure of challenge, and I still have a lot to learn, it was a fun and rewarding experience.

Extensive attributions can be found in the code comments, as I referred to a lot of different information online to build an understanding of GO, and how to utilize it for this task.

Thanks,
Matt Ready
